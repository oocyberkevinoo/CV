<h2 class="w3-theme-l2">Profile</h2>
<p>self-taught developer since I was 14, I started learning with some web langages to create my website,<br>
to finally learn PHP and see the power of programming. Continuing with custom servers customization,<br>
modding, then finally creating fangames with pre-made engines, learning how they works,<br>
and now fully working on Unity to make all sort of applications and prtotype of games I wish to give life to.<br><br>

That gave me the weapons to create my association and build stuff with both my software and hardware knowledge<br>
to give life to my projects, and show it during events.<br><br>

Years after years, I've learned to build precise stuff to help modding communities in their working,<br>
creating tools that will make life easier to work on games that have supportive community.<br>
I gained experience in making games, VR and AR applications, editing softwares, working with more hardware, etc.<br><br>

I'm passionate by all of that, and tend to seek for more, learn more, and hope to give my knowledge <br>
to a company that share that passion for the media, and that will help me getting better with experience.<br>
My will to participate in the industry is what give me the strength to go on.<br><br>

Now, I specialized myself into C# langage and Unity for software and games;<br>
and I'm learning C++ actively to exploit it in Unreal Engine.<br><br>

I worked for one year in a communication agency as a developer of Web applications.<br>
That experience taught me how to conceive applications with specifications from a client, seeking for solutions, 
deadlines respect, and group working.<br>
Willing to be as versatile as possible, I continue to learn other technologies, languages, and engines.<br>
